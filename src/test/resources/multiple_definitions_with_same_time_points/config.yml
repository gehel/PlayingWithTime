 # A list of commands representing the way to add a permission and/or group to a user.
 # The defaults utilize LuckPerm commands, but you can change this to utilize any other
 # method of updating group or permission to your users.
 # Make sure you use the correct placeholders:
 # Available placeholders for commands:
 # - %playername% Player name
 # - %timeingame% Player's time in game, in minutes.
 # - %typename% for the name of the permission or group that you want your user to be added to.
 # You can add multiple commands -- all will be run when the process decides to add a group or permission
 # to a player.
 # NOTE: If no commands are specified, the system will NOT be able to add groups or permissions!
commands_definition_add:
   # Raw command to add a group to a user. The added groups are defined in each config in the 'add' section.
  add_group: 'lp user %playername% parent set %typename%'

  add_permission: 'lp user %playername% permission set %typename% true'
 # A list of ranks to use. Each rank name will be defined in a separate file that's defined
 # in a separate config, determining the in-game time to activate and the resulting permission
 # or groups to be added to the player when that time is met.
